# Phish Statistics Visualizations

When I was first learning how to write Python, my first real project was (like many others) a web scraper. I wanted to apply the coding skills I'd started to develop in a way that could combine two of my biggest interests: music and statistics. Naturally, the answer was to make a crude object-oriented phish.net crawler and then proceed to "do statistics" on the results.

While my coding practices were suspect to say the least, this experience helped me to build foundational Python skills and solidified my interest in analytics and data science.

A common adage in the Phish community is to "never skip a Sunday show." The idea is that, after playing a weekend-long run at a venue, the band is most comfortable and at their peak on the final day. Phish.net provides crowdsourced ratings for each show; I ran a t-test to determine whether the mean of all possible Sunday shows and all possible non-Sunday shows were different. They were. This doesn't mean Sunday shows are better or worse: it just means that Phish fans rate Sunday shows higher than other shows.
