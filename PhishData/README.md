# Phish Statistics Visualizations

When I was first learning how to write Python, my first real project was (like many others) a web scraper. I wanted to apply the coding skills I'd started to develop in a way that could combine two of my biggest interests: music and statistics. Naturally, the answer was to make a crude object-oriented phish.net crawler and then proceed to "do statistics" on the results.

While my coding practices were suspect to say the least, this experience helped me to build foundational Python skills and solidified my interest in analytics and data science.
