# LiveLessful Analytics

In my Sophomore year, I worked in a team of 5 to build a digital brand as a joint Marketing/IT class project.
My main task was to work with the twitter content creator to collect, analyze, and generate insights from the data that Twitter let us export.

These visualizations were either part of Exploratory Data Analysis, or used in our final presentation where I described our reach maximization strategy and content insights we could use in the future.
